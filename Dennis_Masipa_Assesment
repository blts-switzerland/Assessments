- We need to do clean up of the file as part of the ETL (to ensure we don't lose any data)
- We need to design the Data Warehouse using the Kimball Methodology (Facts and Dimensions)
- Firstly we need to create Dimension for transaction status and cater for any future inserts and updates ( create our own keys )
- We need to create another dimension for transaction type
- We then include the dimenssion keys into the Fact table ( we can call it Transaction)
- This will allow the data pipeline to be robust
